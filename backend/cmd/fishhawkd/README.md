# fishhawkd

Fishhawk control-plane daemon binary: the backend HTTP API server plus its operational subcommands
(`serve.go`, `migrate.go`, `token.go`, `audit_rehash.go`).

## Work-management provider registration at startup (#1104)

`workmgmt_wiring.go` — `registerWorkmgmtProviders(cfg.GitHub, jiraClient)`, called from `serve.go`,
registers each work-management provider gated on its OWN client:

- A configured **GitHub** client registers the `github_projects` work-item provider
  (`*githubclient.Client` satisfies the work-item `API` interface directly) **and** the
  product-feedback provider — the latter via `feedbackAPIAdapter`, since
  `FeedbackAPI.SearchOpenIssues` returns the workmgmt/github `MatchedIssue` type.
- A configured **Jira** client registers the `jira` work-item provider.

An unconfigured client leaves that provider unregistered, and the affected endpoint keeps returning
**501** — the v0 not-yet-wired posture. This is the wiring behind #1104: `fishhawk_file_issue` /
`fishhawk_report_product_issue` answer 501 unless the providers are registered.
